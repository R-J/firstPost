# firstPost
Vanilla Forums plugin that adds a CSS class to the first comment and first discussion of a user.

The plugin uses the Attributes column of Comment/Discussion table. When you have a forum with many discussions and/or comments, you could run into problems for older posts since they might never be indexed. It will be now problem for new posts, though. The css file is only for demonstration purposes: it's really ugly...
